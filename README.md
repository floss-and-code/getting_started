# FLOSS and Code Hack Day

Presented by Opportunity Hub (OHUB), Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Friendship Foundation and GitHub, The FLOSS and Code event is a one-day hackathon where attendees will get hands-on experience contributing to meaningful open source projects on GitHub. Companies of all sizes need open source software to run effectively and hiring managers at major technology companies have cited regularly that candidates with open source experience consistently stand out from the rest.

## Attendee expectations
This event is open to programmers from all levels of experience. Individuals are expected to have a basic understanding of programming and the ability to contribute to projects using GitHub. For those interested in attending, but do not have that experience, they can take our [Introduction to GitHub course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

## What is FLOSS?
Free licensed open-source software (FLOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to improve the design of the software voluntarily. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing, and the source code is usually hidden from the users.

## The "How to contribute to Open Source" Guide
There is an excellencent guide on how to contribute to open source at [opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Finding a project to work on
Contributing to open source happens at all levels, across projects and design, documentation, operations, and code. You don’t need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look

### A project you already use
Start by thinking about the projects you already use or want to use. The projects you’ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to.

### An issue you can fix

## What do I do if I am stuck or blocked?
Please! Ask for help. There will be mentors in the room available to help with brainstorming on ideas and technical experts to help unblock your developer environment. Mentors are open and available through our [OHUB FLOSS Slack](https://ohub-floss-atl.slack.com).
